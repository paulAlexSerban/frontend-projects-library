              <strong>Jeremiah "Jerry" P. Thomas (October 30, 1830 – December 15, 1885)</strong>
              was an American bartender who owned and operated saloons in New York City. Because of his pioneering work
              in popularizing cocktails across the United States as well, he is considered "the father of American
              mixology". In addition to writing the seminal work on cocktails, "The Bar-Tender's Guide" (alternately
              titled "How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant's Companion"), Thomas displayed creativity and showmanship
              while preparing drinks and established the image of the bartender as a creative professional. As such, he
              was often nicknamed the "Professor" Jerry Thomas.

              </h3>
              <p class="a-paragraph__base">
                Thomas was born about 1830 in Sackets Harbor, New York. As a young man, he learned bartending in New
                Haven, Connecticut before sailing for California during its mid-19th century Gold Rush. While in
                California, Thomas worked as a bartender, gold prospector and minstrel show manager. According to his
                1885 obituary, he was left some money by his father, which helped in these travels.
              </p>
              <p class="a-paragraph__base">
                Thomas moved back to the East Coast in 1851, settling in New York City. He opened a saloon below
                Barnum's American Museum; it would be the first of four saloons he would run in New York City over his
                lifetime. After running this first bar, Thomas went on the road for several years, working as the head
                bartender at hotels and saloons in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California;
                Charleston, South Carolina; and New Orleans, Louisiana. At one point he toured Europe, carrying along a
                set of solid-silver bar tools. He was well known for his showmanship as a bartender: he developed
                elaborate and flashy techniques of mixing cocktails, sometimes while juggling bottles, cups and mixers.
                He often wore flashy jewelry and had his bar tools and cups embellished with precious stones and metals.
                At the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, Thomas was earning $100 a week—more than the Vice President of
                the United States.

              <p class="a-paragraph__base">
                In 1862, Thomas finished "Bar-Tender's Guide" (alternately titled "How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant's
                Companion"), the first drink book ever published in the United States. The book collected and codified
                what was then an oral tradition of recipes from the early days of cocktails, including some of his own
                creations; the guide laid down the principles for formulating mixed drinks of all categories. He would
                update it several times in his lifetime to include new drinks that he discovered or created. The first
                edition of the guide included the first written recipes of such cocktails as the Brandy Daisy, Fizz,
                Flip, Sour and variations of the earliest form of mixed drink, Punch. The 1876 edition included the
                first written recipes for the Tom Collins, which appeared just after The Tom Collins Hoax of 1874.

              </h3>
              <p class="a-paragraph__base">
                Thomas developed his signature drink, the Blue Blazer, at the El Dorado gambling saloon in San
                Francisco. The drink is made by lighting whiskey afire and passing it back and forth between two mixing
                glasses, creating an arc of flame. Thomas continued to develop new drinks throughout his life. His
                mixing of the Martinez", which recipe was published in the 1887 edition of his guide, has sometimes been
                viewed as a precursor to the modern martini. Thomas claimed to have invented the Tom and Jerry and did
                much to popularize it in the United States; however, the history of the drink predated him.

              <p class="a-paragraph__base">
                Upon returning to New York City, he became head bartender at the Metropolitan hotel. In 1866 he opened
                his own bar again, on Broadway between 21st and 22nd Streets, which became his most famous
                establishment. Thomas was one of the first to display the drawings of Thomas Nast. In his saloon he hung
                Nast's caricatures of the political and theatrical figures; one notable drawing, now lost, was of Thomas
                "in nine tippling postures colossally." The saloon included fun-house mirrors. This historic bar has
                been adapted for use as a Restoration Hardware store.

              <p class="a-paragraph__base">
                Thomas was an active man about town, a flashy dresser who was fond of kid gloves and his gold Parisian
                watch. He enjoyed going to bare-knuckle prize fights, and was an art collector. He enjoyed traveling. By
                middle age he was married and had two daughters. Always a good sport, at 205 pounds he was one of the
                lighter members of the Fat Men's Association. He had a side interest in gourds; at one point in the late
                1870s, Thomas served as president of The Gourd Club after producing the largest specimen.

              <p class="a-paragraph__base">
                Toward the end of his life, Thomas tried speculating on Wall Street, but bad judgments rendered him
                broke. He had to sell his successful saloon and auction off his considerable art collection; he tried
                opening a new bar but was unable to maintain the level of popularity as his more famous location. He
                died in New York City of a stroke (apoplexy) in 1885 at the age of 55. His death was marked by
                substantial obituaries across the United States. The New York Times obituary noted that Thomas was "at
                one time better known to club men and men about town than any other bartender in this city, and he was
                very popular among all classes." He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.
